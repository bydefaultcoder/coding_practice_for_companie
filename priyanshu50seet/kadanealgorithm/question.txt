🟢 EASY (Understand the Core)
1️⃣ Maximum Subarray Sum

Problem
Given an integer array, find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.

✔ Classic Kadane
✔ Must solve in O(n)

2️⃣ Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

Problem
Given stock prices, find the maximum profit by buying and selling once.

✔ Kadane on price differences
✔ Converts problem to max subarray

3️⃣ Maximum Prefix Sum

Problem
Find the maximum prefix sum of the array.

✔ Prefix logic (no reset)
✔ Helps differentiate from Kadane

🟡 MEDIUM (Variants & Twists)
4️⃣ Maximum Circular Subarray Sum

Problem
Array is circular. Find maximum subarray sum.

✔ Use Kadane twice
✔ Handle all-negative case

5️⃣ Maximum Product Subarray

Problem
Find contiguous subarray with the maximum product.

✔ Track both max & min
✔ Negative numbers twist

6️⃣ Maximum Sum Subarray of Size at Least K

Problem
Find maximum sum of subarray with length ≥ k.

✔ Prefix sum + Kadane
✔ Hybrid logic

🟠 HARD (Advanced Kadane Applications)
7️⃣ Maximum Subarray with One Deletion

Problem
Find maximum subarray sum after deleting at most one element.

✔ DP-style Kadane
✔ Two states

8️⃣ Maximum Sum Rectangle in 2D Matrix

Problem
Find the rectangle with maximum sum in a matrix.

✔ Apply Kadane on compressed rows
✔ 2D → 1D reduction

9️⃣ Maximum Absolute Subarray Sum

Problem
Find the maximum absolute sum of any subarray.

✔ Kadane + inverse Kadane
✔ Trick problem

🔟 Split Array for Maximum Subarray Sum

Problem
Split array into two non-overlapping subarrays such that sum is maximized.

✔ Prefix Kadane + Suffix Kadane
✔ Precomputation

🧠 How to Solve (MANDATORY METHOD)

For each problem:

Write brute force idea (mentally)

Identify where reset happens

Track currentSum and maxSum

Handle all-negative edge case

Dry run with at least one example

🔑 Kadane Master Rule (MEMORIZE)

If current sum becomes worse than starting fresh, reset.

❌ Common Conceptual Mistakes

Confusing prefix sum with Kadane

Initializing currentSum = 0

Forgetting negative-only arrays

Resetting blindly without comparison

🎯 Completion Milestone

If you can solve Problems 1–7 confidently, you are strong in Kadane.
Problems 8–10 put you at advanced competitive level.
